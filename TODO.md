# Todo

- Move shader variable definitions for Diligent to somewhere user-controllable (think shaderlab)
- Allow user control of PSO description
- Custom HLSL preprocessor to allow for CG-like code (shaderlab)
- Tiered cbuffers (PerScene, PerCamera, PerObject)
- Default hlsl include for cbuffer defs + other misc stuff
- FIX THE FUCKING VENDOR FILE STRUCTURE PLEASE
- SHORTEN THE GODDAMN COMPILATION TIMES AAAAAAAAAAAH
- Texture loading
- Refactor RenderTexture? Maybe??
- Actual camera components
- Remove wierd shit from GraphicsSubsystem
- Maybe make DiligentContext purely static?
- Allow loading shaders from file
- Figure out wtf is wrong with relative paths in Assimp
- CBuffer structs in cpp code, instead of writing raw elements (how tho)
- Wrap buffer creation API
- Higher level rendering API (DrawRenderer?)
- Split DiligentInit.cpp into multiple files, one for init / deinit, one for draw-related commands
- Refactor ImGuiDiligentRenderer to use DiligentContext instead of raw IDeviceContext
- Threaded rendering?
- Disable ENTT Empty Type Optimization (just define ENTT_NO_ETO=1 globally)
- Cleanup literally all the code in src/graphics, and look through src/core
